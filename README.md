**The worldâ€™s first trustless wealth management platform.**

High-Net-Worth Individuals use exclusive wealth management platforms operated by humans to generate a return on their idle capital and allocate it to asset classes and causes they believe in. Sandclock does too, with more elegance, trustlessness, and sustainability.

When you deposit to Sandclock, **the contract invests your initial deposit to a predetermined strategy chosen by you,** then, it automagically splits your principal from the yield generated. You can then subdivide them however many times you want and stream your yield (or principal) to _**anything**_ you want.

* **Keep:** what you keep.
* **Give:** what you donate to a not-for-profit or program; it entitles you to an NFT that can be burned for a charitable tax deduction.
* **Invest:** what you allocate to an asset you want the profits to be transmuted into.
*   **Custom:** what you allocate to another wallet or smart contract (that supports it!); _This is key as it leads to many novel use cases that we will be announcing in due time_.
