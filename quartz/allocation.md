# Allocation



<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/chart.svg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Team 20%, DAO 80%.</p></figcaption></figure>

The community will become responsible for spending of DAO QUARTZ upon deployment of Snapshot and then, the DAO. Our recommendation for the allocation no longer contains hard values. Instead, we list all the relevant areas for efficient DAO spending:

* Insurance

* Liquidity Mining/Bonds

### Charity Mining: Permalocked Tokens

At least 30% of QUARTZ shall remain locked in perpetuity. The purpose of this QUARTZ is to incentivize Giving or other actions on-chain without diluting existing holders. **It achieves this through a delegative function,** whereby a trusted backend can delegate voting power to an address on Polygon without transferring ownership of the tokens.

It was initially designed in order to incentivize giving, but it can fulfill other objectives while preserving the value of QUARTZ.
