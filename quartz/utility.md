# Utility

The $QUARTZ token is Sandclock's token. For the sake of completeness this page will list current and future utility.

## Governance

Token holders participate in governance and have control over protocol parameters and $QUARTZ distribution. Initially, [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org) will be used until the DAO has been deployed.&#x20;

## Fee capture

Sandclock's metavaults charge a performance fee over the yield generated. **The fee is owned by $QUARTZ holders.** However, instead of using it for immediate value accrual, this fee is redeposited to the protocol as a SPONSOR and thus, **the yield generated by this capital is used to boost all deposits,** thereby creating a positive feedback loop.

In the future, if the DAO desires, a rageQuit() function can be implemented, where burning $QUARTZ will withdraw a proportional account of the treasury to the account owner. Other value accrual mechanisms will also be considered, pending a DAO vote.

## Insurance Claim

_**(soonâ„¢)**_

Lindy Labs is setting up a captive insurance fund. However, as all things TradFi, this is a laborious process and the ETA is hard to estimate.
