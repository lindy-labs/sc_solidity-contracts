# Utility

The $QUARTZ token is Sandclock's token. For the sake of completeness this page will list current and future utility.

{% hint style="info" %}
Reading about the DAO's[#philosophy](./#philosophy "mention") is heavily recommended.
{% endhint %}

## Governance

Token holders participate in governance and have control over protocol parameters and $QUARTZ distribution. For more details, check out [#governance](utility.md#governance "mention").

## Fee capture

Sandclock's metavaults charge a performance fee over the yield generated. **The fee is owned by $QUARTZ holders.** However, instead of using it for immediate value accrual, this capital is redeposited to the protocol as a SPONSOR and thus, **the yield generated by this capital is used to boost all deposits,** thereby creating a positive feedback loop, attracting more capital, and therefore, more fees.

In the future, if the DAO desires, a rageQuit() function can be implemented, where burning $QUARTZ will withdraw a proportional amount of the treasury to the account owner. Other value accrual mechanisms will also be considered, pending a DAO vote.

## Insurance Claim

_**(soonâ„¢)**_

Lindy Labs is setting up a captive insurance fund. However, as all things TradFi, this is a laborious process and the ETA is hard to estimate. Staking QUARTZ and proving your uniqueness will allow you to tap into this insurance.
