# Governance

Sandclock is a community owned project, governed by QUARTZ token holders.

## Governable Actions & Params

* Timelock

A timelock is applied to every deposit in order to mitigate certain economic exploits. Once the DAO has been deployed, it will be configurable by QUARTZ holders. Until then, every strategy deployed will have a very low timelock.

* Performance Fee

The performance fee is charged on top of the yield generated. It is owned by QUARTZ holders and varies per strategy.

* QUARTZ Allocation

Tokens in the treasury can be deployed in order to boost the growth of our ecosystem, at the discretion of QUARTZ holders.

* Non-technical Proposals

A non-technical proposal is any proposal without a specification. An example of such a proposal would be to add a `rageQuit()` function to QUARTZ in order to modify its value accrual mechanisms. Another example would be a marketing proposal, or deploying to another chain.
