# Strategies

One of Sandclock's missions is to bring safe, sustainable yield to anyone looking to generate a return on their deposits. Thus, yield generation is Sandclock's beating heart.

To this end, each metavault supports a single highly curated strategy, selected specifically to endure changing market conditions and perform well throughout themâ€”bull, bear, or crab. The risks for each strategy as well as the conditions for their success are carefully disclosed during onboarding.

Our strategies are divided into parts currently v1 and v2.

v1 are our old strategies following our metavault structure. These strategies are to be deprecated soon.

v2 are our new strategies which follow the ERC4626 Vault standard.&#x20;

You can find details on each of these in the next pages.
