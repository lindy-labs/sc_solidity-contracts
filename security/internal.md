## Smart Contract Testing [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lindy-labs/sc\_solidity-contracts/badge.svg?branch=main\&kill\_cache=1)](https://coveralls.io/github/lindy-labs/sc\_solidity-contracts)

Sandclock's codebase features a comprehensive test suite, relying on unit and integration tests, as well as advanced fuzzing assertion tests and even CVL specifications.

### Formal Verification

Mission critical parts of Sandclock's contracts have been formally verified by Lindy Labs. For information on which properties have been proven, check the Vault [properties.md](../specification/vault/properties.md "mention") and Strategy [properties.md](../specification/strategies/properties.md "mention") documents.
