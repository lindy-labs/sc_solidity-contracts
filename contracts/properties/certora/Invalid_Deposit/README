In this folder, the idea was to find Certora spec files
to show revert operations individually happening when
running the deposit operation.

However, as explained in the Valid_Deposit folder, this
can only be possible iff absolutely all revert situations
are identified and only one allowed to happen per property.

As such a situation is similar to a "proof by contradiction",
maybe it is enough to have the Echidna test cases instead
of proofs using the Certora Prover.
