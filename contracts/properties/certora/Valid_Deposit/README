In this folder we can find two Certora spec files:

(i) Valid_Deposit_NoRevert.spec: This file is the
standard way Certora Prover works. That is, it avoids
any possible revert of a function and focus on the
properties of interest. In our case, deposit satisfies
all 4 expected properties;

(ii) Valid_Deposit_Explicit_Not_Working.spec: This
file is not working because it is an extension of the
above one, considering that reverts can happen. And thus
to be fully functional, Certora Prover needs that ALL
revert possibilities be explicitly stated. As Vault
has overflows/underflows and other situations not caught
but accepted, this way is somewhat strange to pursue. This
file was kept to another discussion in the future.
