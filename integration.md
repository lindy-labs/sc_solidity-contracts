# Integration

Integrating your smart contract into our v2 strategies is as simple as depositing or withdrawing from a [ERC4626 Vault](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/).

You call the _deposit()_ or _mint()_ method to deposit into the Vault and the _withdraw()_ or _redeem()_ method to withdraw your funds from the contract.

Our scUSDC strategy is a very good example for taking reference into how to integrate into our v2 strategies.
